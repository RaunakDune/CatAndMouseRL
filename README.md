"To demonstrate Reinforcement Learning at work, we have developed an applet that uses RL methods, and learns to play a game. The particular game we chose was Cat and Mouse. 

For those of you unfamiliar with the game, it is a simple game. There is a cat, a mouse, a piece of cheese as well as some obstacles in the cat and mouse world. The mouse tries to avoid getting caught by the cat, at the same time trying to get to the cheese to eat it. The mouse is the one learning in the applet, the cat is already programmed to go for the mouse.

When the applet loads, either choose one of the pre-specified obstacle layouts or have one randomly generated for you."
